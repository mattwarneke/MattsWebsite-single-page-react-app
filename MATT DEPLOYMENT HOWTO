Struggled with this to begin with.. Cant get it to auto deploy to the githubpages for now.

npm run build
Once built there is a new folder inside the project build/
Inside is index.html it will NOT run as all the locations of scripts and css are built thinking it will be the root of whatever server it is on.
package.json -->  "homepage": "https://mattwarneke.github.io/",
Has the default path and site that it will run on, if added path after it will be in all the paths: https://mattwarneke.github.io/my-project/ so that will be /my-project/

Then take the build CONTENTS and past into https://mattwarneke.github.io/ repository.
This can be automated alot better see:
https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment
https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages

but couldnt get the post deploy to to work. would be great to just t: npm run deploy
